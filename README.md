CI-AJAX-Pagination
==================

Codeigniter Ajax Pagination Example

Technologies & libraries
•	CI 2.1.3
•	jQuery
•	FancyBox
•	MySQL
•	Twitter bootstrap

Technical things you can learn from this project:
•	Database (In future if required then you can add index to the column that are present in “WHERE” clause)
•	PHP & OOPS concepts
•	jQuery validation, html manipulation (you can use jQuery validator or other similar libs)
•	jQuery ajax pagination, form submission
•	Neat & clean CSS
•	JSON
•	Sortable columns
•	Security
•	View templates

Need to change following configuration settings:
1.	Base_url (/config/config.php)
2.	Database (/config/database.php)

In this project, nothing is special, I am using same CI pagination lib,
but using jQuery & ajax functionality, it will be the good project.
I know your are good programer and you would like to debug the project to understand the work flow.

Here are some tips to  quick debug:
1. Review all item-xxxx.php templates
2. store.php controller code
